        text4: 'The Cool Blues live in the north, where the mountains are covered in snow and the days are cold. They like to dance "The Bump" slow.',

        text3: "In rehearsal the Red Hots and Cool Blues practiced their dances separately. Now they'll be dancing at the same time. It should be exciting to see.",
        text4: "Why do you think the dancers changed so they all dance at the same speed?",
        text5: "The dance floor is so crowded! When the dancers bump into each other the Red Hots slow down and the Cool Blues speed up. Before you know it they're all dancing at the same speedâ€”not too fast, not too slow.",
        text6: "Uh oh. This is not the best start to the Annual Bump Dance Festival! The Red Hots and Cool Blues are disappointed because they couldn't dance their routines the way they practiced."}},

        text5: "So did the room separator work? What might we do next to make it work better?",
        text6: "It was a good idea. The separator kept the Red Hots and the Cool Blues separated so they could each dance their routines, one fast and the other slow. But then there were two problems. First, the dance teams bumped into the separator. Then, the separator bumped into the dancers. After a while, everybody moved at the same speed. The people of the Land of Bump needed a better solution to save the Annual Bump Dance Festival. Explain what you think they should do so both teams can share the dance floor without changing each other's routines."}},

        text3: 'more!"',
        text4: "Now this was a great idea! They added another separator to the dance floor, leaving extra space between the lines. Would this work?",
        text5: "Explain what you think will happen when the Red Hots and Cool Blues start to dance.",
        text6: "Explain how two separators will work better than one.",
        text7: "Success! The Red Hots bumped into their own separator, but that separator did not bump the Cool Blues. The Cool Blues bumped the other separator, but that separator did not bump the Red Hots. They could each perform their routine at the festival exactly how they had practiced it."}},
